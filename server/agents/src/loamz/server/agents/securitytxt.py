"""`/.well-known/security.txt` (RFC 9116): where to report a vulnerability, on every public server.

    from loamz.server.agents.securitytxt import install
    install(app)

Operators point it at their own contact with `LOAMZ_SECURITY_CONTACT` (a `mailto:` or https URL) and
`LOAMZ_SECURITY_POLICY`. The defaults are this project's private vulnerability reporting and its security policy. The
`Expires` field is six months after the process started, so a long-running cell does not advertise a stale file for long.
